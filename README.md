Game modelling in Racket for the fast-paced two-player card game [Jaipur](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur).

This is primarily an exercise in (a) coding up Euro-style games, and (b) improving my Racket skills and idioms.
This extensively uses optics (i.e. lenses) to access and manipulate the game state data structure.
The approach is very similar to my [Purescript version](https://github.com/alphajuliet/jaipur) but the lens code is much simpler. Racket is like that.
